# Hi, I'm Assistant

Assistant is an AI that only knows one valuable skill (addition).  With your help they can learn more!

## Using Assistant

Ensure you have `python 3.x` on your machine and are using that to run `assistant.py` which may look like the following:

```
$ python assistant.py
```

_Note: If you move any files outside of the project directory, Assistant may not work correctly._

## What Does Assistant Already Know How to Do?

Not much; asking Assistant for help will give you the following result:
```
I am Assistant. I can help you with a variety of simple tasks.
These are the things I know how to do:
	Add - Find the sum of two numbers
		In: 2 int => Out: 1 int
	Learn - Used to teach Assistant new skills
		In: 1 str => Out: None
	Help - Display this dialog
		In: None => Out: None
	Exit
```

## Disclaimer

I am doing a lot of this VERY WRONG.  There will be many more proven, efficient ways to achieve the visible goal of this project.  The main goal is to force myself to think outside of the box and work on a project that a) differs from my other work, and b) incorporates a variety of skills into one cohesive unit, using what I have previously learned and what I can learn along the way.
